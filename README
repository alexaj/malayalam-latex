-------------------

This is version 0.9.7 of LaTeX for Malayalam.
Instructions for installing the distribution can be found
in the file INSTALL. An installation script is provided
for Linux systems.

Using the TeXLive distribution is highly recommended, since
development of teTeX is now frozen, and T.E. himself recommends
using TeXLive.
